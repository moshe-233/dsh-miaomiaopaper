/**
 * dsh-wallpaper-engine — host half type surface.
 *
 * The host plugin contributes no public Cordis services and registers no model
 * tool. It serves 36 same-origin HTTP routes through `ctx.webServer` and unwinds
 * them on unload; `docs/ROUTE-INDEX.md` is the generated table of those routes
 * and stays authoritative for their paths and handlers.
 *
 * Exactly one of those routes leaves the machine: `GET /wallpaper-engine/star-count`
 * fetches the repository's star count from the public GitHub API (read-only, no
 * credentials, 10-minute cache plus an on-disk fallback). Everything else serves
 * local data — including `GET /wallpaper-engine/about-qr/<file>`, which hands out
 * the two contact QR codes shipped in `lib/about/` (whitelisted names only).
 *
 * `webServer` is a HARD dependency, declared by `inject` below: the Loader waits
 * for the HTTP server to mount before running this plugin, and a profile with no
 * HTTP server does not load the bundle at all. `ctx.webServer` is read directly
 * at mount time; it is never reached through `ctx.get`.
